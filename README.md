# Simulate-Camera
This project is used to simulating the Camera sensor, using opencv and Python. The script is used in parallel with docker containers running Kafka message broker and cassandra database for storage.

By the way, the code is easy to understand, simply open the Camera.py and I guess there is nothing hard there for you to scratch your head!
